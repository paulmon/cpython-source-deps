cpython-source-deps
===================

Source for packages that the CPython build process depends on.

It is currently expected that this will only be useful on Windows,
and in any case you should never need to clone this repository
unless you are updating its contents.

Updating Source Dependencies
----------------------------

The procedure for updating the different source dependencies are similar.  Below
is an example for updating SQLite::


1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Checkout a new branch off the ``sqlite`` branch. Assuming this repo is set
   as your ``upstream``::

      git checkout -b <branch-name>-sqlite upstream/sqlite

3. Download SQLite source from `sqlite.org <https://www.sqlite.org>`_.

4. Unzip it to the branch checked out in step 2.

5. Commit and push the changes.

6. Create the PR, with ``sqlite`` as the base branch.

Once the PR has been merged, tag the commit as ``sqlite-<full version to be used in CPython's PCbuild/get_externals.bat>``.

For updating ``sqlite``, ``bzip2``, ``xz``, and ``zlib``, follow the above
instructions.

For ``tcl`` and ``tk``, after step 5, `cpython-bin-deps
<https://github.com/python/cpython-bin-deps/>`_
needs to be updated.  Note though that ``tcl85`` and ``tk85`` are specific
to 2.7 and don't require anything extra.

For ``openssl``, step 5 will be more complicated :)

For ``libffi``, before step 5 each include/<arch>/fficonfig.h and 
include/<arch>/ffi.h must be generated by running CPython's PCBuild/configure_headers.bat.

Tagging the commit
------------------

Using the ``sqlite`` branch as an example::

   git checkout -b sqlite-tag upstream/sqlite
   git tag sqlite-3.21.0.0  # replace 3.21.0.0 with the correct version.
   git push --tags upstream
